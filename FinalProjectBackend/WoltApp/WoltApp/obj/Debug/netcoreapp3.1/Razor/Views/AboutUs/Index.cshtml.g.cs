Today, we’re also increasingly known for enabling people to get the same Wolt delivery experience from virtually any type of grocery store, retail shop or boutique within the city.

                    Wolt launched in the summer of 2015 in Helsinki, Finland together with ten restaurants. In the seven short years since we launched, we’ve expanded to 23 countries and more than 250 cities, serving millions of customers together with more than a hundred thousand courier partners as well as tens of thousands of restaurant and retail partners. Behind all that growth is a lot of lessons learned and mistakes made, which have shaped us to become the company we are today.

                    Wolt is – essentially – building new infrastructure. We build a connection between restaurants and retailers that want to make and sell food and other products, couriers that want to earn through delivering those products, and customers who want to free up time and effort to focus on the more important things in life. By doing this, we make our cities also better places to live. And by “better” we mean happier people: happier small enterprises that have more business and that can employ more people, happier couriers that have a flexible way to earn when they choose, happier customers who now have easy access to a great meal or anything else they need, exactly when and where they need it - and who get to save some of t");

                    Our vision is to build the digital world version of the shopping malls we used to frequent, this time brought to the convenience of our homes and workplaces within the half-hour or so. We started with the food court on top the floor, and have since expanded to groceries on the ground floor along with all the other shops, stores and boutiques in the middle – and we’re still only getting started.

                    <li>We decided the name of the company and filed all the paperwork. Wolt was the final name we were all able to agree on. One of our founders, Mika, was browsing through a list of imaginary punk band names and “Volt United” ultimately turned into Wolt.

                    <li>Our official company name becomes Wolt Enterprises, as the Finnish trade registry didn’t accept just “Wolt Inc”.
