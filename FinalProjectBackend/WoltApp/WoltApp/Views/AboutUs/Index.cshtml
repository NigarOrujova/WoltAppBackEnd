                <h4>What is this Wolt thing anyway?</h4>
                <p>
                    We are a Helsinki-based technology company known for our food delivery platform. We make it easy for hungry people to find great food from our restaurant partners to either pick it up themself, or have it delivered by one of our delivery partners. Today, we’re also increasingly known for enabling people to get the same Wolt delivery experience from virtually any type of grocery store, retail shop or boutique within the city.

                    Wolt launched in the summer of 2015 in Helsinki, Finland together with ten restaurants. In the seven short years since we launched, we’ve expanded to 23 countries and more than 250 cities, serving millions of customers together with more than a hundred thousand courier partners as well as tens of thousands of restaurant and retail partners. Behind all that growth is a lot of lessons learned and mistakes made, which have shaped us to become the company we are today.

                <h4>Companies usually have a “mission and vision”. What are ours?</h4>
                <p>
                    Wolt is – essentially – building new infrastructure. We build a connection between restaurants and retailers that want to make and sell food and other products, couriers that want to earn through delivering those products, and customers who want to free up time and effort to focus on the more important things in life. By doing this, we make our cities also better places to live. And by “better” we mean happier people: happier small enterprises that have more business and that can employ more people, happier couriers that have a flexible way to earn when they choose, happier customers who now have easy access to a great meal or anything else they need, exactly when and where they need it - and who get to save some of their precious time while they are at it.

                    Our vision is to build the digital world version of the shopping malls we used to frequent, this time brought to the convenience of our homes and workplaces within the half-hour or so. We started with the food court on top the floor, and have since expanded to groceries on the ground floor along with all the other shops, stores and boutiques in the middle – and we’re still only getting started.

                <h3>How about the journey so far, how has it been?</h3>
                <h4>2014: Wolt was founded in Helsinki, Finland</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Founding team of six with five focused on product development</li>
                    <li>Our first office was a 10-square-meter space in central Helsinki where we all worked together in one room for the first 9 months of our existence.</li>
                    <li>We decided the name of the company and filed all the paperwork. Wolt was the final name we were all able to agree on. One of our founders, Mika, was browsing through a list of imaginary punk band names and “Volt United” ultimately turned into Wolt. (Name contenders included amazing options like Blueberry Pie, Skyliner, Zaplane and Sergei). </li>
                    <li>Our official company name becomes Wolt Enterprises, as the Finnish trade registry didn’t accept just “Wolt Inc”. The other founders later learned that our founding CEO Miki had just seen Fifty Shades of Grey, where Grey Enterprises sets the scene, and thought it would be a good practical joke to name the company so (the other founders did not agree when they heard about it much, much later).</li>
                    <li>This was also the year of the Sochi Olympics. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2015: Our first delivery in Helsinki!</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>14 employees by the end of September</li>
                    <li>We moved to a bigger office in Ruoholahti, just downstairs from the Supercell office. We even had the Apple chief of the App Store visit our office just after we’ve launched, as courtesy of Supercell. We were probably the smallest app maker they’d ever visited (and they didn’t disagree).</li>
                    <li>We raised a 2.5 million euro seed round of financing. </li>
                    <li>This was also the year Star Wars the Force Awakens had its premier.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2016: Expansion to Sweden and Estonia</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>60 employees by end of September</li>
                    <li>We opened an office in Stockholm, hurraa! We also expanded into our first cities outside of Helsinki – the cities of Turku and Tampere in Finland.</li>
                    <li>We raised 10 million euros in the so-called A-round of financing. The round was led by EQT Ventures.</li>
                    <li>This was also the year that Stranger Things premiered.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2017: Expansion to Denmark, Latvia and Lithuania</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>86 employees by end of September</li>
                    <li>We replaced third party tools with in-house created courier apps and our own logistics backend.</li>
                    <li>Adele won the Grammy for Album of the Year.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2018 Expansion to Croatia, Czech Republic, Norway, Hungary, Georgia, Israel and Poland</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>223 employees by end of September</li>
                    <li>We entered hypergrowth and went from 100 to 300 people (by end-of-year) at our offices</li>
                    <li>We raised a 27 million euro B-round of financing. The round was led by 83North.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2019 Expansion to Serbia, Greece, Azerbaijan, Slovakia, Slovenia and Kazakhstan</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>569 employees by end of September</li>
                    <li>We partnered with South Pole to compensate for the CO2 emissions from Wolt deliveries (dating all the way back to the first delivery)</li>
                    <li>We raised 115 million euros in a so-called C-round, led by ICONIQ Capital and Highland Europe.</li>
                    <li>Also the year of the Game of Thrones final season.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2020 Expansion to Cyprus, Malta, Japan and Germany</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1430 employees by end of September</li>
                    <li>We added grocery and retail into the Wolt app. We took action to keep ordering on Wolt as safe as possible, e.g. deliveries as no-contact. </li>
                    <li>We raised €100 Million from existing investors and Goldman Sachs Growth Equity and €7.5 Million from Delivery Hero’s co-founder Lukasz Gadowski</li>
                    <li>We became a unicorn, yey!</li>
                    <li>The year of the Covid-19 pandemic.</li>
                </ul>
